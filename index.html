                The three main theories of how humans can be restored by views or sounds of the
                <em>natural environment</em> are still being developed as new research outcomes are added.
                Biophilia hypothesis explains how over 1 million years a genetic imprint has become
                established that can relate to the savannah-like environment where humans have spent
                over 95% of their development8
                . The two restorative theories &lpar; Attention Restoration
                Theory &lpar;ART&rpar; and <em>Psychophysiological stress</em> recovery theory&rpar;  both try to explain the
                mechanism by which restoration can take place. The main difference is that ART is a
                more voluntary method that affects thought processes and so measured by
                psychological parameters, whereas the Psychophysiological stress recovery theory is an
                involuntary reaction based older part of our brain and which is measured physiologically. </p>

                An adult’s attitude to the environment and time spent in <em>green space</em> is strongly
                influenced by their experience as a child. Children who spend time in woodland with
                friends or alone without parental supervision are the most likely to visit and enjoy
                woodland as an adult. These adults are also more likely to describe woodland as
                “magical” and are less anxious when visiting woodland alone. The critical age of
                influence appears to be before 12yrs. Before this age contact with nature in all its forms
                but in particular wild nature appears to strongly influence a positive behaviour toward
                the environment. The sense of freedom of unstructured play that occurs in nature
                creates a source of independence and inner strength that can be drawn upon during
                stressful situations for the rest of their life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some researchers describe the lack of connection between children and the natural
                environment as an <em>“extinction of experience”</em>. This means that each generation will
                pass on less experience of the natural environment and as policy makers and future
                environmentalists they will have a poorer understanding of nature and so give it less
                value.
